**jscsrc-guesser** â€“ JSCS configuration guesser

**jscsrc-guesser** is a tool that checks some code base and finds those JSCS
rules the code base follows.

This version emits rules for JSCS 2.0.0.

## Installation

    $ npm install -g jscsrc-guesser

## Usage

Just run `jscsrc-guesser` with your code path(s) as argument(s):

    $ jscsrc-guesser bin/ lib/ tests/ > autogenerated.jscsrc

You can also pass some optional arguments you could pass to `jscs`:

    $ jscsrc-guesser --esnext index.js > autogenerated.jscsrc
