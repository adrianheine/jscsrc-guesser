**jscsrc-guesser** â€“ JSCS configuration guesser

**jscsrc-guesser** is a tool that checks some code base and finds those JSCS
rules the code base follows.

## Installation

    $ npm install -g jscsrc-guesser

## Usage

Just run `jscsrc-guesser` with your code path(s) as argument(s):

    $ jscsrc-guesser bin/ lib/ tests/ > autogenerated.jscsrc

You can also pass some optional arguments you could pass to `jscs`:

    $ jscsrc-guesser --esnext index.js > autogenerated.jscsrc

## Todo

### Fixes
* Handle all different possible values for all rules
* Don't put opposing rules in jscsrc just because they didn't fail
* Fold multi-value options back to true

### Features
* Compare to presets or existing jscsrc
* Sort rules in output alphabetically
* Add i18n
* Check which rules checked successfully instead of which rules didn't fail
* Handle rules which failed rarely (for example by interactively proposing to
add them to the output)
